# Qhack_open


This repository will contain the code for The Quantocks submission to QHack '22.

Start with the notebooks in the root folder to see how the algorithm works.

The aim  of this project i sto implement the algorithm described in [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10495.pdf) paper. The inital aim wil be to replicate results for the zero tempreture regime. After this, the finite tempreture algorithm will be considered. Finally, time permitting, we will look for data about other molecules to input to the algorithm.
